ELEPHANT SPEED CALCULATOR FUNCTION
====================================

FILE: elephant_speed_calculator.txt
STATUS: Text file placeholder for future development
CREATED: 2025-01-26
VERSION: 1.0 (Placeholder)

DESCRIPTION:
This file contains the specifications and algorithms for calculating elephant speed
based on various factors. Currently implemented as a text file, this will be
developed into a full PHP function later.

SPEED CALCULATION FACTORS:
--------------------------

1. BASE SPEED (by elephant type):
   - Asian Elephant: 25 km/h
   - African Bush Elephant: 30 km/h
   - African Forest Elephant: 22 km/h

2. AGE FACTORS:
   - Young (0-10 years): +15% speed
   - Adult (11-30 years): Base speed
   - Senior (31-50 years): -20% speed
   - Elderly (51+ years): -35% speed

3. WEIGHT FACTORS:
   - Light (< 3,000kg): +10% speed
   - Normal (3,000-5,000kg): Base speed
   - Heavy (> 5,000kg): -15% speed

4. TERRAIN FACTORS:
   - Flat grassland: Base speed
   - Forest: -25% speed
   - Hills: -30% speed
   - Water: -40% speed
   - Mud: -50% speed

5. HEALTH FACTORS:
   - Excellent: +10% speed
   - Good: Base speed
   - Fair: -15% speed
   - Poor: -30% speed
   - Critical: -50% speed

6. WEATHER FACTORS:
   - Clear: Base speed
   - Light rain: -5% speed
   - Heavy rain: -20% speed
   - Extreme heat: -15% speed
   - Cold: -10% speed

7. TIME OF DAY:
   - Dawn (5-7 AM): +5% speed
   - Morning (7-11 AM): Base speed
   - Afternoon (11-3 PM): -10% speed
   - Evening (3-7 PM): +5% speed
   - Night (7-5 AM): -20% speed

CALCULATION ALGORITHM:
----------------------

Base Speed × Age Factor × Weight Factor × Terrain Factor × Health Factor × Weather Factor × Time Factor = Final Speed

EXAMPLE CALCULATION:
-------------------

Elephant: Raja (Asian Elephant)
- Base Speed: 25 km/h
- Age: 25 years (Adult) = 1.0
- Weight: 4,500kg (Normal) = 1.0
- Terrain: Grassland = 1.0
- Health: Good = 1.0
- Weather: Clear = 1.0
- Time: Morning = 1.0

Final Speed = 25 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 = 25 km/h

FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION:
----------------------

This will be converted to a PHP function with:
- Database integration for real-time data
- API endpoints for speed calculations
- Real-time monitoring and updates
- Historical speed tracking
- Predictive speed modeling
- Integration with drone tracking system

FUNCTION SIGNATURE (PLANNED):
----------------------------

function calculateElephantSpeed($elephantId, $terrain, $weather, $timeOfDay) {
    // Get elephant data from database
    // Apply all factors
    // Return calculated speed
    // Log calculation for analysis
}

INTEGRATION POINTS:
------------------

1. Elephant Management System
2. Drone Tracking System
3. Real-time Monitoring Dashboard
4. Alert System (speed anomalies)
5. Historical Data Analysis
6. Predictive Maintenance

NOTES:
------

- All percentages are approximate and based on research data
- Factors may be adjusted based on real-world observations
- Speed calculations should be updated every 5-10 minutes
- Historical data should be stored for trend analysis
- Speed anomalies should trigger alerts for monitoring staff
